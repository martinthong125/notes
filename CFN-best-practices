# Cloud Formation Best Practices

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html

The order to setup AWS resources in Cloud Formation (Multi-layer architecture & Service oriented architecture)

1. Identity
2. Base Network
3. Shared Services
4. Backend Services
5. Frontend Services

\*\*\* Never use default resources created by AWS

\*\*\* Create your resources dynamically instead of hard-coding the values whenever possible

\*\*\* ssh CIDR should not be 0.0.0.0/0 for production

\*\*\* Never make changes to your stack without using the template. If not, it will create drift on the stack.

\*\*\* Create access keys only when you need to use it. Do not store any active access keys.

\*\*\* Use creation policy with EC2 and ASG (Auto Scaling Group)

\*\*\* Use update policy with ASG

\*\*\* Use parameters with constraints

\*\*\* Run drift detection before performing stack operations!!!
